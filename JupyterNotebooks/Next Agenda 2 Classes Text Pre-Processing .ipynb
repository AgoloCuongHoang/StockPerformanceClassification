relative current therapies following table summarizes most advanced product candidates product candidate indication stage development commercialization rights pimavanserin parkinson disease psychosis phase iii acadia schizophrenia phase ii acadia alzheimer disease psychosis phase ii acadia agn xx yy chronic pain phase ii allergan ac glaucoma phase allergan am schizophrenia ind track meiji seika asia acadia rest world acadia has established protocol future phase ii feasibility study alzheimer disease psychosis pimavanserin overview pimavanserin new chemical entity discovered have advanced phase iii development potential first class treatment parkinson disease psychosis pimavanserin small molecule product candidate can taken orally tablet once day pimavanserin selectively blocks activity ht receptor drug target plays important role psychosis hold worldwide rights pimavanserin have established patent portfolio which includes numerous issued patents generically covering pimavanserin well issued patents specifically covering pimavanserin united states europe several additional countries have selected parkinson disease psychosis lead indication pimavanserin currently focused advancing phase iii program indication also believe pimavanserin has potential address range additional neurological psychiatric indications undeserved currently marketed antipsychotics have completed phase ii trial pimavanserin co therapy schizophrenia have established protocol future phase ii feasibility study explore potential pimavanserin treatment alzheimer disease psychosis future intend use phase iii parkinson disease psychosis program foundation develop commercialize pimavanserin these other potential central nervous system indications through collaboration strategic partners table contents pimavanserin treatment parkinson disease psychosis phase iii development pimavanserin treatment parkinson disease psychosis currently there no therapies approved treat parkinson disease psychosis united states believe pimavanserin may effectively treat psychosis patients parkinson disease without compromising motor control thereby significantly improving quality life these patients result believe if approved pimavanserin will offer significant advantages relative current antipsychotics used off label treatment parkinson disease psychosis currently conducting several studies phase iii program pimavanserin parkinson disease psychosis including phase iii trial referred study designed evaluate efficacy tolerability safety pimavanserin treatment patients parkinson disease psychosis study multi center double blind placebo controlled trial expected enroll about patients clinical centers located united states patients randomized two study arms receive oral doses either mg pimavanserin placebo once daily six weeks patients also continue receive stable doses their existing dopamine replacement therapy used manage motor symptoms parkinson disease primary endpoint study antipsychotic efficacy measured using items hallucinations delusions domains scale assessment positive symptoms saps employ independent centralized ratings assess primary endpoint study motoric tolerability key secondary endpoint study measured using parts ii iii unified parkinson disease rating scale updrs study builds signals efficacy observed earlier studies incorporates several study design enhancements based previous data experience have gained parkinson disease program addition study continuing conduct open label safety extension study referred study involving patients parkinson disease psychosis who have completed earlier phase iii studies well patients who complete study patients eligible participate study if opinion treating physician patient may benefit continued treatment pimavanserin study together similar extension study still ongoing earlier phase ii parkinson disease psychosis trial has generated considerable amount long term safety data pimavanserin total over patients have now been treated pimavanserin over one year longest single patient exposure greater than six years believe experience date suggests long term administration pimavanserin safe well tolerated fragile elderly patient population september announced top line results initial phase iii trial pimavanserin patients parkinson disease psychosis referred study while study impacted larger than expected placebo response did not meet its primary endpoint signals antipsychotic efficacy were consistently observed pimavanserin mg study arm these signals were most prominent united states portion study which comprised nearly one half patients study study met key secondary endpoint motoric tolerability pimavanserin safe well tolerated study basis data study during concluded second phase iii trial referred study early analyzed study order use findings support design study study mg pimavanserin arm showed signal efficacy primary assessment scale statistically significant difference placebo secondary outcome measure study met key secondary endpoint motoric tolerability pimavanserin safe well tolerated study announced top line results multi center double blind placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial pimavanserin patients parkinson disease psychosis trial met primary endpoint which demonstrate administration pimavanserin did not result deterioration motoric function these patients measured updrs pimavanserin also showed antipsychotic effects secondary endpoints using two different rating scales including saps pimavanserin safe well tolerated study table contents pimavanserin co therapy schizophrenia combining pimavanserin low dose antipsychotic drug such risperidone commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic drug believe optimal relationship between ht receptor blockade partial dopamine receptor blockade can achieved therefore believe co therapy pimavanserin may result enhanced efficacy fewer side effects relative existing treatments thereby providing improved therapy patients schizophrenia potentially related psychiatric disorders reported positive results multi center double blind placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial designed evaluate pimavanserin co therapy patients schizophrenia trial results showed several advantages co therapy pimavanserin mg low dose risperidone patients schizophrenia these advantages included enhanced efficacy comparable mg standard dose risperidone faster onset antipsychotic action improved side effect profile including significantly less weight gain compared standard dose risperidone if elect pursue further development indication future expect will through collaboration partner pimavanserin treatment alzheimer disease psychosis patients alzheimer disease psychosis parkinson disease psychosis share many common characteristics they typically elderly frail often exhibit similar psychiatric symptoms associated their underlying neurodegenerative disease preclinical models alzheimer disease psychosis have shown pimavanserin attenuates psychosis related behaviors those models addition pimavanserin has been shown positively interact muscarinic agonists cholinesterase inhibitors enhance their pro cognitive antipsychotic actions preclinical models because its mechanism action favorable safety profile observed date studies conducted elderly patients parkinson disease psychosis believe pimavanserin also may ideally suited address need new treatment alzheimer disease psychosis safe effective well tolerated have established protocol phase ii feasibility study evaluate potential pimavanserin treatment alzheimer disease psychosis while resources currently focused phase iii program parkinson disease psychosis intend pursue planned feasibility study alzheimer disease psychosis future independently collaboration partner agn xx yy collaboration allergan have discovered developing new class small molecule product candidates treatment chronic pain novel alpha
