trial pimavanserin patients parkinson disease psychosis trial met primary endpoint which was demonstrate that administration pimavanserin did not result deterioration motoric function these patients measured updrs pimavanserin also showed antipsychotic effects secondary endpoints using two different rating scales including saps pimavanserin was safe well tolerated study table contents pimavanserin co therapy schizophrenia combining pimavanserin low dose antipsychotic drug such risperidone commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic drug we believe that optimal relationship between ht receptor blockade partial dopamine receptor blockade can be achieved therefore we believe co therapy pimavanserin may result enhanced efficacy fewer side effects relative existing treatments thereby providing improved therapy patients schizophrenia potentially related psychiatric disorders we reported positive results multi center double blind placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial designed evaluate pimavanserin co therapy patients schizophrenia trial results showed several advantages co therapy pimavanserin mg low dose risperidone patients schizophrenia these advantages included enhanced efficacy comparable that mg standard dose risperidone faster onset antipsychotic action improved side effect profile including significantly less weight gain compared standard dose risperidone if we elect pursue further development indication future we expect that will be through collaboration partner pimavanserin treatment alzheimer disease psychosis patients alzheimer disease psychosis parkinson disease psychosis share many common characteristics they are typically elderly frail often exhibit similar psychiatric symptoms associated their underlying neurodegenerative disease preclinical models alzheimer disease psychosis we have shown that pimavanserin attenuates psychosis related behaviors those models addition pimavanserin has been shown positively interact muscarinic agonists cholinesterase inhibitors enhance their pro cognitive antipsychotic actions preclinical models because its mechanism action favorable safety profile observed date studies conducted elderly patients parkinson disease psychosis we believe that pimavanserin also may be ideally suited address need new treatment alzheimer disease psychosis that safe effective well tolerated we have established protocol phase ii feasibility study evaluate potential pimavanserin treatment alzheimer disease psychosis while our resources are currently focused our phase iii program parkinson disease psychosis we intend pursue our planned feasibility study alzheimer disease psychosis future independently collaboration partner agn xx yy collaboration allergan we have discovered are developing new

our patents sat will expire over range foreign patents covering sat will expire over range competition we face will continue face intense competition pharmaceutical biotechnology companies well numerous academic research institutions governmental agencies both united states abroad we compete will compete applicable existing new products being developed our competitors some these competitors are pursuing development pharmaceuticals that target same diseases conditions that our research development programs target each our clinical programs we intend complete clinical trials designed evaluate potential advantages our product candidates compared current standard care even if we our collaborators are successful developing our product candidates resulting products would compete variety established drugs areas parkinson disease psychosis schizophrenia alzheimer disease psychosis chronic pain glaucoma example our potential product treatment parkinson disease psychosis will

glaucoma treatment had worldwide sales billion table contents addition companies described above other competitors may have variety drugs development awaiting fda approval that could reach market become established before we have product sell our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit market any drugs that we may develop some our competitors are using functional genomics technologies other methods identify validate drug targets discover novel small molecule drugs many our competitors their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do following identifying validating targets screening compounds against targets preclinical clinical trials potential pharmaceutical products obtaining fda other regulatory clearances addition many our competitors their collaborators have substantially greater advantages following areas capital resources research development resources manufacturing capabilities sales marketing smaller companies also may prove be significant competitors particularly through proprietary research discoveries collaborative arrangements large pharmaceutical established biotechnology companies many our competitors have products that have been approved are advanced development we face competition other companies academic institutions governmental agencies other public private research organizations collaborative arrangements pharmaceutical biotechnology companies recruiting retaining highly qualified scientific management personnel licenses additional technologies our competitors either alone their collaborators may succeed developing technologies drugs that are more effective safer more affordable more easily administered than ours may achieve patent protection commercialize drugs sooner than us developments others may render our product candidates our technologies obsolete our failure compete effectively could have material adverse affect our business government regulation manufacturing marketing our potential products our ongoing research development activities are subject extensive regulation numerous governmental authorities united states other countries before marketing united states any new drug developed us must undergo rigorous preclinical testing clinical trials extensive regulatory clearance process implemented fda under federal food drug cosmetic act amended fda regulates among other things development testing manufacture safety efficacy record keeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale distribution biopharmaceutical products none our product candidates has been approved sale united states any foreign market regulatory review approval process which includes preclinical testing clinical trials each product candidate lengthy expensive uncertain united states product candidates are tested animals until adequate proof safety established clinical trials new product candidates are typically conducted three sequential phases that may overlap phase trials involve initial introduction product candidate into healthy human volunteers emphasis phase trials testing safety adverse effects dosage tolerance metabolism distribution excretion clinical pharmacology phase ii involves studies limited patient population determine initial efficacy compound specific targeted indications determine dosage tolerance optimal dosage identify possible adverse side effects safety risks once compound shows evidence table contents effectiveness found have acceptable safety profile phase ii evaluations phase iii trials are undertaken more fully evaluate clinical outcomes before commencing clinical investigations humans we our collaborators must submit fda investigational new drug application ind regulatory authorities may require additional data before allowing clinical studies commence proceed one phase another could demand that studies be discontinued suspended any time if there are significant safety issues we have past may future rely some our collaborators file inds generally direct regulatory approval process many our potential products clinical testing must also meet requirements clinical trial registration institutional review board oversight informed consent health information privacy good clinical practices establish new product candidate safety efficacy fda requires companies seeking approval market drug product submit extensive preclinical clinical data along other information each indication data information are submitted fda form new drug application nda generating required data information
