products ongoing research development activities subject extensive regulation numerous governmental authorities united states countries before marketing united states new drug developed must undergo rigorous preclinical testing clinicaltrials extensive regulatory clearance process implemented fda federal food drug cosmetic act amended fda regulates among things development testing manufacture safety efficacy record keeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale distribution biopharmaceutical products none drug candidates has been approved sale united states foreign market regulatory review approval process includes preclinical testing clinicaltrials each drug candidate lengthy expensive uncertain united states drug candidates tested animals until adequate proof safety established clinicaltrials new drug candidates typically conducted three sequential phases overlap phasei trials involve initial introduction drug candidate into healthy human volunteers emphasis phasei trials testing safety adverse effects dosage tolerance metabolism distribution excretion clinical pharmacology phaseii involves studies limited patient population determine initial efficacy compound specific targeted indications determine dosage tolerance optimal dosage table contents identify possible adverse side effects safety risks once compound shows evidence effectiveness found acceptable safety profile phaseii evaluations phaseiii trials undertaken more fully evaluate clinical outcomes before commencing clinical investigations humans collaborators must submit fda investigational new drug application ind regulatory authorities require additional data before allowing clinical studies commence proceed one phase another could demand studies discontinued suspended time there significant safety issues past future rely some collaborators file inds generally direct regulatory approval process many potential products clinical testing must also meet requirements institutional review board oversight informed consent good clinical practices establish new drug candidate safety efficacy fda requires companies seeking approval market drug product submit extensive preclinical clinical data along information each indication data information submitted fda form new drug application nda generating required data information nda takes many years requires expenditure substantial resources information generated process susceptible varying interpretations could delay limit prevent regulatory approval stage process failure demonstrate adequately quality safety efficacy drug candidate development would delay prevent regulatory approval drug candidate cannot assure you even clinicaltrials completed either collaborators will submit applications required
